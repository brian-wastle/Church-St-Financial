## Description

Church St. Financial (CSF) is an stock trading education website with a hands-on approach for students new to finance. This website allows you to create an account with which you can invest up to $100,000 in "CSF Credit", and then track your investments as they grow or shrink. Our UI is designed for ages 14+, so very little knowledge is required to get started. Many of the terms on the site provide a definition on mouse hover, with some introductory equations mixed in as well. Students can explore details about the businesses they want to invest in by browsing with our advanced search options. When students decide their nest egg is large enough, they can sell off their shares and see who has become the most savvy investor.
